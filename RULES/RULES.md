## **Combat Round**

Now players create their wand by placing one core and one wood, if they have any, in front of them. Discard any unused wand components 

The players should now only have spell cards in their hands. The goal is to reduce the other players health total from 10 to 0. 

Players now take turns readying their spells. A player can only play one spells a turn but has the option to "prep" any spell. That is, play it face down on the board. A player can only have 2 prepped spells at a time and can reveal it at any point, even during an opponents turn. 

Spells, instants, and prepped spells are resovled based on a stack with the last one in being resolved first.

EX 1: Player one has shield prepped. PLayer 2 plays fireballs. Player one triggers the prepped shield and blocks 2 damage. 

EX 2: Player one has shield prepped. Player 2 has counter prepped. Player 2 plays fireball. Player 1 triggers prepped shield. Player 2 triggers prepped counter. Since the stack is resovled top down, counter is triggered first to counter the shield. Since shield is counter it's removed from the stack and fireball is cast without impediment. 

Once spells have been resolved move that spell to your discard pile (which is just a pile off to the side). Once your entire hand is in the discard pile, shuffle and return to hand.

Rinse and repeat until there is a victor!
