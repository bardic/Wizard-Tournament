#### **Bidding Round**

 - Players can bid on any number of cards they want. If they are out-bidded, their tokens are returned.
 - Replace cards that were purchased new ones from top of deck and give each player 2 more tokens
 - Repeat 4 more times. 

#### **Combat Round**

Now players create their wand by placing one core and one wood, if they have any, in front of them. Discard any unused wand components 

The players should now only have spell cards in their hands. The goal is to reduce the other players health total from 10 to 0. 

Each player chooses a spell from their hand and plays it face down. Once both players have chosen a spell, reveal them and resolve them simultaneously unless otherwise stated on the spell. 

Once spells have been resolved move that spell to your cooldown pile (which is just a pile off to the side). Each spell requires 1 turn of cooldown after being cast (unless otherwise stated on the card) before returning to your hand. 

Rinse and repeat until there is a victor!
