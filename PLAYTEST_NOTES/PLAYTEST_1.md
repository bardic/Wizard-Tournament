- Add a base attack card 
- Swiftness is too strong
- Shield is broken / Tweak wording to be about offensive spells? 
- Remove cooldown pile. Replace with discard. Once hand is empty shuffle and return to hand
- After bid, clear the cards on the board
- Maybe have a min hand size? Or players start with 2 basic attacks/defense spells 
- More damage spells are needed
- Remove "this turn" actions
- Cards need to have 'Type' on them
